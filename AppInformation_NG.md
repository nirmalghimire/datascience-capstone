This presentation highlights the capstone project for the Coursera/John Hopkins Data Science Specialization Program.

It's a 10-course specialization program that offers a range of skills  on R and data analyses in order to prepare students to become data scientists.

Introduction to the Project
========================================================
Divided in Multiple Small Scale Tasks this Capstone Project Tapped into Following Skill Sets:
- This project kicked-off with an intention of analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover structure in the data and how the words are put together. 
- Using the learned skills during the Data Science Specialization, this project wanted us to, analyze text data using natural language processing skills. 
- The natural language processing was component was created using variety of R packages. 
- Creating a Shiny app that takes multiple words (a phrase) as input and predicts next word in a series. 
- The provided data were broken into the training data set and test data set. 

Getting and Cleaning Data
========================================================
- Large databases comprising of text in a target language are commonly used when generating language models for various purposes.
- Tokenization - identifying appropriate tokens such as words, punctuation, and numbers. Writing a function that takes a file as input and returns a tokenized version of it.
- Profanity filtering - removing profanity and other words you do not want to predict.

These steps were followed by:

- Exploratory analysis - perform a thorough exploratory analysis of the data, understanding the distribution of words and relationship between the words in the corpora. 
- Understand frequencies of words and word pairs - build figures and tables to understand variation in the frequencies of words and word pairs in the data.

Modeling and Creative Exploration
========================================================
- The goal of this exercise component was to is to build and evaluate first predictive model using the n-gram and back off models that I built in previous tasks to build and evaluate your predictive model. The goal was to make the model efficient and accurate. 
- Evaluate the model for efficiency and accuracy - use timing software to evaluate the computational complexity of the model I came up with. I then evaluated the model accuracy using different metrics like perplexity, accuracy at the first word, second word, and third word. 
- The predictive accuracy of the model was evaluated based on the prediction capability and the models' accuracy and efficiency.
